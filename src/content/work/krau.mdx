KRAU is an application that I developed as part of my Bachelor's thesis. The concept emerged from the rapid development and improvement of Generative Image Models at the beginning of 2022. KRAU was created in response to the following question: What might the future look like if designers were to enter into a profound, symbiotic relationship with AI?

KRAU is a cloud-based web application that proposes such a future. By combining multiple machine learning models, existing workflows can be accelerated and entirely new avenues of creative expression can be explored. The minimum viable product (MVP) developed as part of this thesis provides insight into how KRAU could be used in future, showcasing an exemplary workflow pipeline.
