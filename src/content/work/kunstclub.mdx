Kunstclub Bayreuth e.V. is a newly founded association dedicated to promoting young people in the field of art and culture.

I developed a comprehensive visual identity for the association that is playful and cheerful yet clear and concise, featuring bold colours, clean lines and charming animations. Part of the logo and also the Kunstclub's mascot is a cat, whose curiosity and self-confidence embody what the association wants to promote in young people. An extensive collection of cat illustrations gives the association the flexibility to communicate moods and activities and use the mascot for various occasions.

For the technical implementation of the website, I chose the open-source framework Astro, which makes the creation of high-performance static pages as easy as possible thanks to integrated Markdown support and automatic asset optimisation.
