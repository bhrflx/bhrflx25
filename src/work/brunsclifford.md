BrunsClifford is an avant-garde sportswear brand emerging from Paris. They offer a limited selection of carefully hand-crafted pieces designed to last. When they approached us with their vision for a new online store, we were immediately captivated by their unique ideas, which distinguish them from the average fashion brand. Working alongside our friends at [Monochroma Design](https://monochroma.design/), who were responsible for the shop's UX and UI design, we set out to create an online store that matched the avant-garde nature of the garments themselves.

We chose Shopify as the e-commerce platform because of its industry-leading features, which cover everything from basic inventory management to complex market and pricing options. In order to realise BrunsClifford's vision, we required maximum technical freedom while maintaining tight integration with the Shopify ecosystem. We therefore opted to build a custom Shopify theme from scratch. Using theme blocks and customisable sections, we enabled BrunsClifford to structure every page of their new store as they wished, without needing developer intervention. Everything can be configured via Shopify's theme editor and admin dashboard, from brand colours and typography to custom sizing charts, eliminating the need for expensive plugins.

We're very proud of the web experience we have created alongside Monochroma for BrunsClifford. Make sure to check out the store and its wonderful garments [here](https://brunsclifford.com)
